    The paper "\textit{PortraitNet: Real-time Portrait Segmentation Network for Mobile Device}" \cite{Zhang2019PortraitNetRP} introduces PortraitNet, a real-time portrait segmentation model designed for mobile devices. It utilizes a lightweight U-shape architecture with two auxiliary losses during training, specifically the boundary loss and consistency constraint loss, to improve accuracy and robustness. PortraitNet outperforms existing methods in accuracy and efficiency, particularly in generating sharper boundaries and handling challenging lighting conditions. Additionally, it can process 224 Ã— 224 RGB images at 30 FPS on an iPhone 7 in real-time.
